# continuous-feedback-app

The application must enable users to provide continuous feedback to a course or tutorial.

The application is built on a Single Page Application architecture and is accessible from the browser on the desktop, mobile devices or tablets (depending on user preference).

# functionalities

As a professor i can define an activity at a particular date, with a description and a unique access code for the activity. The activity is accessible for a set period of time.

As a student, i can input a code to participate in a defined activity. The code can be used for the duration of the activity.

As a student who has accessed an activity I have access to an interface split into 4 rectagles each containing an emoticon (smiley face, frowny face, surprised face, confused face). At any time i can press an emoticon to react to the activity. As a student I can add an unlimited number of feedback instances.

As a professor I can see the continuous feedback stream, with each feedback instance associated to the time it was generated at. I can only see the feedback as anonymous. For myself the feedback is available both during and after the activity.
